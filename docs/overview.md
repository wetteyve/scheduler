# 👀 Overview

This project is based on the official `@napi-rs/package-template`, adapted into a personal Rust utility package called **`@wetteyve/rusty`**.

The original workflows, tooling, and release strategy remain intact. The main goal of this repository is to:

* Experiment with **Rust** and **napi-rs**
* Build reusable utility functions in Rust
* Compile to **all supported napi-rs targets**
* Test native bindings in **Node.js**
* Experiment with **WASM** builds for browser usage
* Learn and explore Rust, Node-API, and WASM side-by-side

This project is primarily a learning and experimentation space. APIs may change frequently, and functionality is added incrementally as Rust, napi-rs, and WASM concepts are explored.
